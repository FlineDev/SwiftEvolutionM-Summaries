# Primary Associated Types in the Standard Library (Summary)

* Full Proposal: [SE-0358](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0358-primary-associated-types-in-stdlib.md)
* Summary Author: [Cihat Gündüz](https://fline.dev/about)
* Article: [Swift Evolution Monthly: May ‘22](https://www.fline.dev/swift-evolution-monthly-may-22/#se-0358-primary-associated-types-in-the-standard-library)

This one is a follow-up proposal to [SE-0346](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0346-light-weight-same-type-syntax.md?ref=fline.dev) (presented in [first issue](https://se-monthly.flinedev.com/issues/swift-evolution-monthly-first-issue-background-history-chris-lattner-6-proposals-1092625?ref=fline.dev)) and basically is about extending the Standard Library with the new primary associated type declarations in order to make SE-0346 actually usable.

See [this table](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0358-primary-associated-types-in-stdlib.md?ref=fline.dev#proposed-solution) for an overview of all the protocols planned to be changed.
