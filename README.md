# [Swift Evolution Monthly](https://swiftevolution.substack.com/?ref=github.com): Proposal Summaries

This repository is here to make it easier to look up summaries of specific Swift Evolution proposals. They were all extracted from the [Swift Evolution Monthly newsletter](https://swiftevolution.substack.com/?ref=github.com) and put into one file each within the `proposals` folder and they are all named after the related proposal file in the [official Swift Evolution repo](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution).

This way, while reading an evolution proposal on GitHub, you can simply replace `Apple` with `FlineDev` in your URL and you'll land on the related proposal summary if one exists. New summaries are added every month, both of new and related old proposals.

You can also navigate to the proposal you're looking for from the [`proposals` folder](https://github.com/FlineDev/swift-evolution/tree/main/proposals).
